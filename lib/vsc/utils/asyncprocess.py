Module to allow Asynchronous subprocess use on Windows and Posix platforms

The 'subprocess' module in Python 2.4 has made creating and accessing subprocess
streams in Python relatively convenient for all supported platforms,
but what if you want to interact with the started subprocess?
That is, what if you want to send a command, read the response,
and send a new command based on that response?

Now there is a solution.
The included subprocess.Popen subclass adds three new commonly used methods:
 - C{recv(maxsize=None)}
 - C{recv_err(maxsize=None)}
 - and C{send(input)}

along with a utility method:
 - {send_recv(input='', maxsize=None)}.

C{recv()} and C{recv_err()} both read at most C{maxsize} bytes from the started subprocess.
C{send()} sends strings to the started subprocess. C{send_recv()} will send the provided input,
and read up to C{maxsize} bytes from both C{stdout} and C{stderr}.

If any of the pipes are closed, the attributes for those pipes will be set to None,
and the methods will return None.

  - downloaded 05/08/2010
  - modified
    - added STDOUT handle
    - added maxread to recv_some (2012-08-30)
